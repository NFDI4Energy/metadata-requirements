# Data point module

A data point is a certain value in the energy context.

## Requirements

### 1) Unit

### 2) Value range

### 3) Context
E.g. volume flow rate (a volume flow rate of water should not be compared to volume flow rate of Methane for example.)
Moreover, is it an absolute temperature or a temperature difference.
part of that could be solved with QUDT:quantityKind

### 4) Data type
what is the computer representation of the values e.g. float, double, int, string, multidimensional?


### 5) Description
What is this data point used for

### 6) Data precision
How many digits will be provided realiably
