# Non-functional requirements

Metadata can come in numerous flavors and therefore should allow to be used in multiple contexts.

## Design
### Metadata Schema

#### 1) üìúLinks between metadata records
|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-LINKED-METADATA|
|**Description**|Help users to traverse semantically linked metadata records that are similiar, different, related, etc. This can involve data from the same or different project, a similar purpose or an explicitly specified difference. This can be achieved using an explicit field for links in the metadata schema|
|**Creation date**|2024-08-15|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Provide a generic metadata module in the schema that focuses on relations to other datasets and think about a good collection of relations between them.|
|**Priority**|Low|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úî Links between metadata records are established at different levels alrady: topics, subject, tags, context! And a seperate field is more difficult to harmonise. |

#### 2) üìúThe metadata schema reuses agreed upon terms and semantics
|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-REUSE-AGREED-SEMANTICS|
|**Description**|It is vital to not create duplicate definitions to improve interoperability. This should be done using pre-existing ontologies wherever possible|
|**Creation date**|2024-09-17|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Importing / Referencing of all ontologies that provide useful terms or semantics|
|**Priority**|High|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úî Based on Datapackage and DCAT-AP |

#### 3) üìúFields in the schema shall use controlled vocabularies as much as possible
|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-CONTROLLED-VOCABULARIES|
|**Description**|Prevent the interoperability issues that arise with custom human input, by using controlled vocabularies for user input where possible|
|**Creation date**|2024-08-15|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Use either ENUM like instances of a type in OWL or specify a base class for terms as child classes, use public identifiers of a certain pattern (e.g. purl, doi, orcid, etc.) - multiple solutions will be necessary. Consider using Terminology services or special term lookup services like the DBpedia Lookup|
|**Priority**|High|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úî OEMetadata has an LOEP feature. |

#### 4) üìúFields need to be categorized by importance

|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-FIELD-IMPORTANCE|
|**Description**|To allow users to quickly grasp which metadata fields are more important we need to cluster them into mandatory, optional, etc. |
|**Creation date**|2024-10-22|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Additional attribute for all metadata fields (compare OEM Badges)|
|**Priority**|Medium|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úî Mandatory and Optional. Badges for additional effort. |


#### 5) üìúModularity


|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-MODULARITY|
|**Description**|To ensure a good quality of metadata for a given entity it is important to have specifically tailored sets of metadata fields. It makes sense to group several fields together if they always appear in a common context. Each of these modules needs to have a precise and limited scope. Smaller is often better in this context.|
|**Creation date**|2024-10-22|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Cluster metadata fields in modules and allow one entity to be annotated by a set of these modules. A strategy to find the correct modules needs to be worked out|
|**Priority**|High|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úî Datapackage has basic structure, additional groups are implemented. But (JSON) nesting is annoying. |


#### 6) üìúLanguage

|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-LANGUAGE|
|**Description**|Since key value maps only see a key equal if it matches 100% it is necessary to have all keys in a common language. We propose to use only English names for the keys. If a serialization format allows multiple languages also other languages can be supported, but English must have the highest priority|
|**Creation date**|2024-10-22|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Just use English keys for the fields and perform translations only with annotation properties|
|**Priority**|High|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úî EN |

#### 7) üîß Metadata Schema Improvement Tools

|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DESIGN-TOOLING-IMPROVEMENT|
|**Description**|To enhance the interoperability of the metadata schema with other metadata schemas and improve the overall quality of metadata, it is important to try to reuse existing terms. Finding these can be aided with the use of terminology search and cross-walks between metadata standards. The used design tools shall assist the developer in applying these mechanisms.|
|**Creation date**|2024-09-23|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Protege can be used to edit the metadata schema. Protege could have useful plugins for terminology search from important other metadata standards. Otherwise a plugin might be configurable against a DBPedia Lookup that was initialized with common metadata standards.|
|**Priority**|Medium|
|**OEMetadata**| ? |


## Implementation

### Metadata Schema

#### 8) üìúProvided schema files

|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-IMPL-SCHEMA-PROVIDED-FILES|
|**Description**|A formalized specification of the schema is necessary. The preferred format is in a semantic format like Turtle/Notation3. Additionally the schema files shall be provided as JSON schema (both plain JSON and JSON-ld) as a convenience for external use cases. Only the semantic format can be considered the root schema and the others most be updated on every change respectively. These types of formats are prioritized because of their validation and form generation capabilities|
|**Creation date**|2024-09-23|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|JSON-Schema files can be generated from an OWL/SHACL specification of the root schema|
|**Priority**|High|

|**Creation date**|2024-09-19|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Triplestore databases easily provide SPARQL endpoints and therefore federation capabilities. Alternatively metadata can be stored in a way that allows for virtual SPARQL endpoints to achieve the same effect.|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úî OEMetadata is part of the Databus / MOSS: https://moss.openenergyplatform.org/ |


#### 10) üìùMetadata serialization formats need to be standardized

|||

|**Description**||
|**Creation date**|2024-08-15|
|**Linked terms**|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C171252, http://edamontology.org/format_1915, https://schema.org/encodingFormat|
|**Solution idea**|This means the preferred serialization formats are RDF/XML, JSON-LD, Turtle, N3 and Ntriples. Nevertheless, other standardized formats as XML, JSON, YAML and TOML are also valid and can be used.|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úîüõ† Used JSON schema. Add RDF. |

#### 11) üìù Metadata record submodules storage structure
|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-METADATA-SUBMODULE-STORAGE-STRUCTURE|
|**Description**|Submodules will need to reference each other and a flat way of storage is superior if multiple submodules might reference the same submodule|
|**Creation date**|2024-10-22|
|**Linked terms**||

### Tooling

#### 13) üîß Metadata record Implementation Tools

|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-IMPL-TOOLING-RECORD-CREATION-SERVICE|
|**Description**|To ensure that the creation of metadata records can be done easily from different application contexts a service solution for the creation can be beneficial. So this service could be embedded via an application plugin. Such a service can therefore support multiple programming languages.|
|**Creation date**|2024-09-23|

## Integration
### Metadata Schema

#### 14) üìúAllow interoperability between existing metadata standards
|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-INTEGRATION-SCHEMA-STANDARD-INTEROPERABILITY|
|**Description**|Metadata records for our schema should be easily interoperable with other platforms that use different schemas, as it prevents re-annotation of metadata in other formats and supports data access to and from other platforms|
|**Creation date**|2024-08-15|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Schema crosswalks to the most relevant standards are helpful for federated searches and form a foundation of format conversions. Scripts shall be provided to convert from and to our schema for a selected set of standards. Evaluate formalized (semantic) formats for crosswalks and recommend one that can be integrated into existing knowledge graphs / ontologies.|
|**Priority**|Medium|

|**Goal**|Create a unified metadata schema that ensures all relevant metadata is included, but can also be customized to specific needs and use cases.|
|**Description**|The metadata integration tools should define explicit rules for what metadata fields are necessary and which are optional. These tools should allow users to select from domain-specific metadata schemas/modules, ensuring that relevant metadata is captured.|
|**Creation date**|2024-09-23|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|The input forms for metadata should be somehow generated. This might require inputs from the developer on what metadata modules are relevant and if certain fields should have a non-standard mandatory state.|
|**OEMetadata**| üõ† Badges to priotise metadata keys. Develop templates for different ressources: timeseries, geodata, parameter...  |

#### 17) üîß Provide export capabilities

## Use 
### Metadata Schema

#### 18) üìúOnline documentation

Each metadata module / profile and each individual metadata field shall have a definition and description text that is available online.

#### 19) üìúUsage guide

The metadata schema needs to be accompanied by an online documentation or guide on how to use it properly.
This shall include different user perspectives including but not limited to data owners, application developers and data registry maintainers. Also it needs to motiviate why the usage of metadata and respective standards is important.

#### 20) üìúVisualize different use of terminology among reused / mapped schemas and ontologies
|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-DOCUMENTATION-TERMINOLOGY-DIFFERENCES|

|**Description**|Some terms are used differently between different standards or use different names for the same thing. The documentation shall provide a way to recognize those cases.|
|**Creation date**|2024-08-15|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Use terminology from thesauri or SKOS to express "similarTerms", "similarButDifferent" and "notToBeConfusedWith" relations.|
|**OEMetadata**| ‚úîüõ† Include SKOS in the metadata crosswalks in OMI. |

#### 21) üìúSchema documentation shall be understandable for users that need to fill or read metadata

|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-USE-SCHEMA-DOCUMENTATION-STAKEHOLDER-USERS|
|**Description**|The schema documentation must provide helpful information to users without semantics or metadata background, so it should not just be focused around developers|
|**Creation date**|2024-08-15|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|This is hard to measure, so for now just involve end users in the design of the documentation.|

#### 22) üìúAllow for a curated way to extend controlled vocabularies

|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-CURATED-CONTROLLED-VOCABS|
|**Goal**|The predifined vocabularies are sometimes not enough - by introducing a mechanism to extend them in a curated way it prevents frustrations for users|
|**Description**|Free text can sometimes describe better what a certain artefact / dataset is about if there are no matching values in a controlled vocabulary. So it would be nice if there would be a simple process to add new items to a controlled vocabulary in a curated way, that does not hinder the workflow of the user|
|**Creation date**|2024-08-15|
|**Linked terms**||
|**Solution idea**|Embedding a terminology search into a metadata input form when there can be no proper choice made to find a reference in an ontology for a term. If the term from the other ontology fulfills yet to be determined characteristics it might be possible to extend the vocabulary with that term (initially for the time the form is active) and on a long run the added "external" terms could be curated and either accepted or revoked centrally for the schema.|

#### XX) üìùMetadata record value languages
|||
|---|---|
|**ID**|REQ-USE-RECORD-LANGUAGES|
